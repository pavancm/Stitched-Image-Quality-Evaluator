# Stitched-Image-Quality-Evaluator

This is the MATLAB implementation of Stiched Image Quality Evaluator (SIQE) presented in the paper:

P. C. Madhusudana and R. Soundararajan, ["Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Stitched Images for Virtual Reality,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8736985) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 28, no. 11, pp. 5620-5635, Nov 2019

## Running on MATLAB

example.m file contains an example implementation of SIQE for the images present in the 'images' folder.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB Pyramid toolbox (can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/matlabPyrTools))
- LIBSVM Package (can be downloaded from [HERE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/#download))

Note on training - This release version of SIQE was trained on the entire ISIQA database.
